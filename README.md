# Getting started

At the begining I have read carefully Test description and made some notes i.e. splitting whole problem into small pieces\
I have created GitHub repository and console app using VSCode

# Step 1 - Console UI
Created simple console UI to interact with User and obtain needed parameters

# Step 2 - Parameters DTO
Created parameters DTO to store User parameters

# Step 3 - Parameters validation
Added Parameters validation & updated parameters DTO to make sure UI is fully ready to use
